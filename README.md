# Sales-Analysis

Sales dataset is my first project as a MeriSKILL intern. Image of details is attached above 
and Recommendations inclusive.
In this project I carried out some actions:
Conducted in-depth sales data analysis using SQL(Google BigQuery) for data querying, and Excel for initial data exploration.
Leveraged Tableau for creating impactful data visualizations, demonstrating expertise in optimizing sales strategies.
